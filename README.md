The Face Recognition Attendance Management System is a comprehensive software solution that offers a range of features to efficiently manage student attendance. It allows users to store student details in a database, along with their photo samples. The system is equipped with facial recognition technology that can identify students and automatically mark their attendance in an Excel file. This eliminates the need for manual attendance tracking, reducing errors and saving time. The system can store facial templates to identify recognized faces and mark attendance, making it a reliable and efficient way to manage student attendance.
